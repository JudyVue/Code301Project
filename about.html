<h2>About the Washington State Attorney General</h2>

The Washington State Attorney General's Office handles multiple complaints that consumers file against private businesses. The office further investigates the claim in order to resolve the consumer's issue. Some complaints may result in the consumer receiving compensation. Other complaints may result in a favorable decision toward the business.

If enough complaints are filed against the same business, the Attorney General has the authority to bring legal action in the State of Washington, but does not have authority to represent an individual consumer.

Due to the high volume of complaints received by the attorney general, and the nature of a complaint not requiring the cooperation of a business, some complaints and/or inquiries can be more efficiently handled by an agency that specializes in the specific business or area of complaint.

<strong>The existence of a complaint is not evidence of wrongdoing.</strong>
